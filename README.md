# SnakeGame
**Language:** Python

**Purpose:** To recreate the Snake Game (for fun!)

**Running the generator:** 
1. Run Engine 
2. If the game is too fast or too slow, change the value in pygame.time.delay() (default is 3 milliseconds). Note that greater delays may also cause more lag. 

**Viewing the game:** `exampleGameRun.MOV` shows an example of the gameplay. See
`exampleBoard.JPG` for what the gameboard looks like.
